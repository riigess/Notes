## Development related notes
- Do not remove an expected multi-platform development environment, it may result in Xcode sporadically crashing during previews/builds with no explanation as to why (and it frequents about once every 5-30 minutes)

## IPSW Files
- An IPSW file is just a compressed ZIP folder with a different extension
- Three DMG files make up the IPSW file structure, with an Info.plist file to provide a way to confirm upgrades/downgrades
